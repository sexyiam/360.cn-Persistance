# 360.cn-Persistance
360.cn has various MTIRE rules to detect various Persistance methods, It even stop any access of Reg Keys/Execution of CMD/PS/Rundll32 possibly via FltRegisterFilter.
It will also disallow you to write any files to startup/sys32.
But for some reason it doesn't flag creation of a scheduled task from COM Objects, bind your UAC Bypass and it will become a weaponized feature for your crypts/applications.
